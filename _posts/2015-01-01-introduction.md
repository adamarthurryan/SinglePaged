## About Me  

I'm an [artist](http://adamarthurryan.com) and a [software developer](http://github.com/adamarthurryan) with a passion for teaching and making! 

I'm currently editor for code course content at [Tuts+](http://tutsplus.com), where I work with a brilliant team of instructors teaching cutting-edge web development practices.
